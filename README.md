Financial Engineering Project - Support Resistance Relative Strength Trading Strategy in China Stock Markets

## Summary
This project studies support resistance relative strength trading strategy by quantifying the support and resistance with daily high and daily low of the stock price in China stock and future markets and using the slope of the linear model as the indicator. The strategy produces annual excess yield of 5.96% in main board market but with maximum drawdown rate over 30%. By making further improvements with MACD, the strategy significantly lifts the sharpe ratio by 20.82% as well as decreases maximum drawdown rate by 80.75% without losing much profit. And the strategy also preforms better than the benchmark index in small and medium enterprise board market, second board market and future market by 2.61%, 3.16% and 15.19% annually. However, the strategy is not very efficient in the future market with negative profit and sharpe ratio. Therefore, the strategy should make further modification.
